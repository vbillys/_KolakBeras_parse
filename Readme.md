# Expenses App for the Lazy

This is not really a readme per say, still much to do and need time. Plan is to grow this quickly when there is time. Key is proper planning and lotsa of documentation.

### ToDo

* Create proper readme
* Create documentation for the code
* Think of the flow work in the backend system, python is proposed.
	* Manual save from bank websites still needed, is ok.
	* Develop python scripts that takes input of the week period, and pull info from       parse.com and the .csv file.
	* Develop the python script further to compare online and non-cash transaction
	* Python script then output the resulting summary and let the user revise the transaction list and then it can be transfered to the logging

### New Features

* List current week transactions
* 

### Futuristic 

* Let's just say that in the future this app would be useful because of its customization
* We should develop the apps in a way that is modular and easy to customize
	* Need to learn to develop framework so that meta design would be possible
